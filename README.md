# Seattle Sidewalk Accessibility - Data Analysis/Visualization Report

This project explores sidewalk accessibility across Seattle using data from the Project Sidewalk initiative. Sidewalk conditions vary widely throughout the city, and barriers such as missing sidewalks or curb ramps can significantly impact mobility for wheelchair users, seniors, and pedestrians. The goal of this project is to better understand where these barriers exist, how severe they are, and which neighborhoods are most affected.

Using geographic analysis and data visualization, we map reported accessibility issues across Seattle and compare conditions between neighborhoods. The project introduces a composite Severity Score that accounts for how frequent issues are, how concentrated they are, and how serious their impact is on mobility and safety. This approach provides a more equitable way to evaluate accessibility conditions citywide. By identifying patterns of infrastructure inequities that may not be obvious from raw counts alone, the analysis helps prioritize areas where sidewalk improvements would have the greatest impact.

The insights and visualizations produced here can support city planners and policymakers to fairly and effectively allocate resources for pedestrian infrastructure in order to create safer, more inclusive urban environments.
